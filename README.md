### Bio

I am a 4th year undergraduate student major in Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining and parallel computation. I also have a well command of algorithms and mathematics. I worked with Prof. [Zhihu Du](http://hpclab.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~duzh) on parallel computation on GPUs, and more specifically, efficient particle-mesh spreading on GPUs. I also worked with Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) on data mining, machine learning, information retrieve and probabilistic graphical models.

### Research Experience

#### Knowledge Engineering Group, Tsinghua University

*Advisor: Jie Tang, 2014/9 - present*

- Identify Experts Online
	- Develop a GUI to accept the input information of the experts entered or from the database.
	- Use the given information to identify the experts on [Baidu Baike](http://baike.baidu.com/), which is a website just like [Wikipeida](http://www.wikipedia.org/) but in Chinese.
	- Try various methods including SVM or Logistic Regression, and achieve *Precision* of 90.9%, *Recall* of 98.5% and *F1* of 94.5%.
	- It's my independent work. And my implementation can be found on [my github repo:IdentifyExpertsInBaiduBaike](http://github.com/billy-inn/IdentifyExpertsInBaiduBaike) and the work is clarified in [my report](http://billy-inn.github.io/Homepage/Identify%20Experts%20In%20Baidu%20Baike.pdf) in Chinese.
- Crawler For Google Scholar
	- Develop a web crawler to wrawl the whole co-author network on Google Scholar using *Scrapy* Framework in Python. 
	- In order to prevet the blockage by Google, I also write several crawler to obtain thounsands of proxy IP and port.
	- This is my independent work. My implementation can be found on [my github](https://github.com/billy-inn) and the work is clarified in [my report]().

#### High Performance Computing Laboratory, Tsinghua University

*Advisor: Zhihu Du, 2014/4 - present*

- Implement Parallel Algorithm
	- Learn the implementation and optimization of parallel algorithm on GPU hardware via CUDA.
	- Try to implement the SVM (Support Vector Machine) and parallelize it on GPU by myself.
	- My implementation can be found at [my github](http://github.com/billy-inn) and the work is clarified on [my blog](http://billyinn.wordpress.com/).
- Algorithm Optimization
	- We optimized all spreading and interpolation algorithms from its granularity to its details in algorithm on GPU.
	- Our work is submitted to IPDPS'2015, the paper can be found [here](http://github.com/billy-inn)

### Publications

### Skills

Programming Languages: C++, Python, LaTeX, CUDA, Matlab, Shell

Speaking Languages: Chinese (mother tongue), fluent in speaking and written English

Mathematics: Interested in *Statistics, Number Theory, Graph Theory, Cominatorics* and learn related textbooks by myself. I also often solve problems on *Euler Project*.

Algorithms: I love participating various programming contest. And I have a rate of 1732 of Codeforces. I also solve the problem on online judge such as LeetCode and write my own solution report, my solution report can be found on [my blog's category:solution](http://billyinn.wordpress.com/category/solutions/). Furthermore, I also read part of the **CLRS** and write my study notes on [my blog's category:CLRS](http://billyinn.wordpress.com/category/algorithms/clrs/)
