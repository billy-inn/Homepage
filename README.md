### Bio

I am a 4th year undergraduate student major in Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining and parallel computation. I worked with Prof. [Zhihu Du](http://hpclab.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~duzh) on parallel computation on GPUs, and more specifically, efficient particle-mesh spreading on GPUs. I also worked with Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) on data mining, machine learning, information retrieve and probabilistic graphical models.
