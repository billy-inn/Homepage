{"name":"Peng Xu","tagline":"Resume","body":"### Bio\r\n\r\nI am a 4th year undergraduate student major in Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining and parallel computation. I worked with Prof. [Zhihu Du](http://hpclab.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~duzh) on parallel computation on GPUs, and more specifically, efficient particle-mesh spreading on GPUs. I also worked with Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) on data mining, machine learning, information retrieve and probabilistic graphical models.\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\n#### Beijing Univesity of Posts and Telecommunications\r\n\r\nBA, 2011-2015(expected)\r\n\r\nGPA 87.13, GPA of major 89.50\r\n\r\n#### Major Courses\r\n\r\n- Probability Theory and Stochastic Process 98\r\n- Mathematical Analysis I 94\r\n- Mathematical Analysis II 89\r\n- Advanced Algebra 91\r\n- Discrete Mathematics 94\r\n- Analytic Geometry of Space 93\r\n- Practicum in Computer Skills 93\r\n- Database Technologies and Applications 91\r\n- Fundamentamentals of Information Theory 95\r\n- C++ Programming Fundamentals 87\r\n- Data Structures 86\r\n\r\n### Research Experience\r\n\r\n#### Knowledge Engineering Group, Tsinghua University\r\n\r\n*Advisor: Jie Tang, 2014/9 - present*\r\n\r\n- Crawl Data On Website\r\n\t- Develop a web crawler to wrawl the whole co-author network on Google Scholar.
