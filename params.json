{"name":"Peng Xu","tagline":"Resume","body":"### Bio\r\n\r\nI am a 4th year undergraduate student major in Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research interests include statistical machine learning, data mining and parallel computation. I also have a well command of algorithms and mathematics. I am working with Prof. [Zhihu Du](http://hpclab.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~duzh) on parallel and distributed computation, and more specifically, efficient particle-mesh spreading on GPUs and handle large amount of images via MPI, Spark and Hadoop. I am also working with Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) on data mining, machine learning, information retrieve, and more specifically, name disambiguation in large scale database.\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\n#### Beijing Univesity of Posts and Telecommunications\r\n\r\nBA, 2011-2015(expected)\r\n\r\nGPA 87.06, GPA of major 89.62\r\n\r\n#### Major Courses\r\n\r\n- Probability Theory and Stochastic Process 98\r\n- Mathematical Analysis I 94\r\n- Advanced Algebra 91\r\n- Discrete Mathematics 94\r\n- Analytic Geometry of Space 93\r\n- Practicum in Computer Skills 93\r\n- Database Technologies and Applications 91\r\n- Fundamentamentals of Information Theory 95\r\n- Digital Signal Processing 91\r\n- Digital Circuit and Logic Design 99\r\n- Signals and Systems 91\r\n\r\n### Research Experience\r\n\r\n#### Knowledge Engineering Group, Tsinghua University\r\n\r\n*Advisor: Jie Tang, 2014/9 - present*\r\n\r\n- Identify Experts Online\r\n\t- Develop a GUI to accept the input information of the experts entered or from the database.\r\n\t- Use the given information to identify the experts on [Baidu Baike](http://baike.baidu.com/), which is a website just like [Wikipeida](http://www.wikipedia.org/) but in Chinese.\r\n\t- Try various methods including SVM or Logistic Regression, and achieve *Precision* of 90.9%, *Recall* of 98.5% and *F1* of 94.5%.\r\n\t- It's my independent work. And my implementation can be found on [my github repo:IdentifyExpertsInBaiduBaike](http://github.com/billy-inn/IdentifyExpertsInBaiduBaike) and the work is clarified in [my report](http://billy-inn.github.io/Homepage/Identify%20Experts%20In%20Baidu%20Baike.pdf) in Chinese.\r\n- Crawler For Google Scholar\r\n\t- Develop a web crawler to crawl the whole co-author network with all their papers on Google Scholar using *Scrapy* Framework in Python. \r\n\t- In order to prevet the blockage by Google, I also write several crawler to obtain thounsands of proxy IP and port.\r\n\t- This is my independent work. My implementation can be found on [my github repo:CrawlerForGoogleScholar](http://github.com/billy-inn/CrawlerForGoogleScholar) and the work is clarified in [my report](http://billy-inn.github.io/Homepage/Crawler%20For%20Google%20Scholar.pdf).\r\n- Develop of **ArnetMiner II**\r\n\t- ArnetMiner is a website that offers comprehensive search and mining services for academic community. I am working on the second version of it.\r\n\t- My work mainly involves with the data, including cache, mongodb, redis and the corresponding computation.\r\n\t- In addition, I am working on improve the performance of name disambiguation of the system and how to handle the new data properly.\r\n\t- The ArnetMiner has been released already, you can visit it [here](http://aminer.org)\r\n\r\n#### High Performance Computing Laboratory, Tsinghua University\r\n\r\n*Advisor: Zhihu Du, 2014/4 - present*\r\n\r\n- Implement Parallel Algorithm\r\n\t- Learn the implementation and optimization of parallel algorithm on GPU hardware via CUDA.\r\n\t- Try to implement the SVM (Support Vector Machine) and parallelize it on GPU by myself.\r\n- Algorithm Optimization\r\n\t- We optimized all spreading and interpolation algorithms from its granularity to its details in algorithm on GPU.\r\n\t- I implement several spreading algorithms. Also do some test work and plot corresponding figures in the paper.\r\n\t- Our work is submitted to IPDPS'2015, the paper can be found [here](http://billy-inn.github.io/Homepage/IPDPS'15.pdf)\r\n- Develop Image Library and Process System\r\n\t- Crawl large amounts of images online first.\r\n\t- Handle those images via parallel computing and distributed systems, more specifically, using MPI, Spark, Hadoop respectively and compare their performance in different situations.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n#### Efficient Particle-Mesh Spreading on GPUs (submitted)\r\n\r\nXiangyu Guo, Xing Liu, **Peng Xu**, Zhihu Du, Edmond Chow\r\n\r\nIn 29th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), 2015\r\n\r\n### Awards\r\n\r\n- 2014 Enter the quarter-final in **Microsoft Programming of Beauty Contest**, rank 134 of 988\r\n- 2013 Bronze Medalist in **ACM-ICPC Hunan Invitational Programming Contest**\r\n- 2013 Gold Medalist in **Programming Contest of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**\r\n\r\n### Skills and Qualifications\r\n\r\nProgramming Languages: C/C++, Python, CUDA, Matlab, Shell, R, Scala\r\n\r\nSoftwares and Tools: LaTeX, Git, LIBSVM, MongoDB, Scrapy, Redis, Spark \r\n\r\nSpeaking Languages: Chinese (mother tongue), fluent in speaking and written English\r\n\r\nMathematics: Interested in *Statistics, Number Theory, Graph Theory, Cominatorics* and learn related textbooks by myself.
